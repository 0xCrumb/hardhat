# Hardhat Ignition

Hardhat Ignition is a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) system for deploying smart contracts on Ethereum. It enables you to describe smart contract instances, identify their dependencies, and establish the operations to run on them. By taking over the deployment and execution, Hardhat Ignition lets you focus on creating the desired contract functionality and outcomes instead of getting caught up in the deployment details.

Built by the [Nomic Foundation](https://nomic.foundation/) for the Ethereum community.
